<h1 align="center">IINA+</h1>

<p align="center">IINA+ is a special build of the <b>modern</b> video player <a href="https://github.com/iina/iina">IINA</a> with additional features and bugfixes.</p>

---

## Features

- HDR playback
- Danmaku ( supports Bilibili only due to the limitation of `yt-dlp`, experimental ). I used some code from [iina-danmaku](https://github.com/xjbeta/iina-danmaku), Thanks [xjbeta](https://github.com/xjbeta)
- AppleScript. I used code from [Wevah's AppleScript support PR](https://github.com/iina/iina/pull/2857), Thanks [Wevah](https://github.com/Wevah)
- LOTS of bug fixes and performance improvements from [low-batt](https://github.com/iina-plus?type=source)

## Statement

IINA+ is built for experimenting the latest features and bugfixes. It may not be as stable as the official one and has a little bit higher os version requirement for quick development, which may not fit everyone's needs. Use it as your own risk.

## About youtube-dl

We no longer embed the outdated youtube-dl. Users must install `yt-dlp` manually for playing network resources.

```sh
$ brew install yt-dlp
```

See [the official document](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme) for detail
